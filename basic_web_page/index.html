      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The first Guild Event in the popular mobile game Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes (SW:GoH),
        it provides an opportunity for a guild to provide a host of rewards for the
        entire guild in a collective effort.  Guild Events require communication
        and application of each guild member's resources in an effort to complete
        various goals including assignment to <a href="#Platoon" >platoon missions</a>,
        <a href="#Combat">combat missions</a>, <a href="#Special">special missions</a> and
        <a href="#General">general deployment</a>.  Rosters refresh after each phase (6 phases)
        and units are employed in increasingly more difficult ways and with more strict
        requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 6 phases breakdown down into 15 sections in total, where the guild can
        earn up to three stars per section up to a maximum of 45 stars.  Only the
        guilds with the highest participation, communication and well-developed
        characters and ships will be able to achieve all 45 stars in the time of the
        event.  The phases and sections break down as follows:

      <h2>Breakdown</h2>
      <div>
        <h3 id="Platoon">Platoon/Squadron Missions</h3>
        <p>
          For platoon and squadron missions, each guild member can assign up to ten (10)
          troops and ships, respectively, to a platoon of 15 characters or ships
          selected by the server.  For each platoon and squadron completely filled,
          the guild collects the assigned amount of territory points (TP) and progresses
          toward the goal of that mission.  For every two (2) platoons completed,
          the guild gains some ability or boost to achieve other objectives.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 id="Combat">Combat Missions</h3>
        <p>
          Combat missions pit a squad of your troops or ships against an increasing
          more difficult waves of enemies with various special abilities and chances
          to be an Elite unit with even more abilities to defeat your squad.  Each
          mission attributes the units assigned to attempt it as deployed power for
          that area as well as additional territory points (TP) for each wave cleared.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 id="Special">Special Missions</h3>
        <p>
          Special missions are considerably more difficult, but, if completed, they
          provide the guild with valuable rewards such as guild event tokens (guild
          event currency) or shards to progress in unlocking and improving various
          new characters.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 id="General">General Deployment</h3>
        <p>
          Once all of the other missions have been completed or the guild member's
          resources are assigned, it is up to the guild member to assign the rest
          of their units accordingly.  For the first phase and for the ship sections
          of phases 3 through 6, the general deployment is simply deploy all remaining
          eligible resources.  For the character sections of phases 2 through 6,
